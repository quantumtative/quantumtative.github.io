    <b>Background:</b> I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at UC Berkeley, as well as a 
    Faculty Scientist in the Mathematics Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
    Here is my <a href="cvLindsey.pdf">CV</a> (9/2024).<br><br>

    <b>Research interests:</b> I work on computational methods driven by numerical linear algebra, optimization, and randomization, with a special focus on 
    high-dimensional scientific computing problems. These include quantum many-body 
    problems arising in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, as well as various problems in applied probability. Approaches draw on a wide variety of 
    techniques including semidefinite relaxation, Monte Carlo sampling, and optimization over parametric function classes such as tensor networks and neural networks.

    <details><summary><b>Convex relaxations and semidefinite programming</b></summary>
    <p style="margin-left:30px; font-size:14px">
    <b><i>Background.</i></b> For many intractable optimization problems, it is possible to formulate 
    a convex relaxation by making use of simple structure in the objective function. Examples range from combinatorial optimization problems (such as the famous Max-Cut problem) 
    to the problem of determining the ground state energy of a quantum many-body system, which is of fundamental importances in 
    quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Relaxations are derived by writing down necessary constraints satisfied by 
    some reduced variable in the original problem. Often the resulting problem has the structure of 
    a semidefinite program (e.g., the Goemans-Williamson algorithm for Max-Cut and the 2-RDM theories of quantum chemistry).
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Quantum marginals.</i></b>
    We have introduced a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00560">new type</a> of 'quantum marginal' relaxation for quantum many-body problems and 
    developed a scalable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02682">solver</a> for it. This relaxation carries the interpretation of a 
    quantum embedding theory (see <u>Quantum embedding</u> below), which motivates the solver.
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Classical marginals.</i></b>
    The aforementioned 'quantum marginal' relaxation extends preceding work on a classical marginal 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08322">relaxation</a> for 
    discrete multi-marginal optimal transport problems. With a multiscale approach, 
    we have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10046">extended</a> this classical marginal relaxation to solve general continuous global optimization problems with pairwise structure, which include 
    sensor network localization and optimal molecular configuration problems.
    <br><br>
    <b><i>General semidefinite programming.</i></b> More broadly I am interested in optimization for general SDP, particularly 
    with low-rank structure.

    <i>Pictured</i>:
    A partition of a lattice system into disjoint fragments.
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Background.</i></b> The fundamental difficulty of quantum 
    many-body problems is that the complexity of the quantum wavefunction grows exponentially 
    with the number of particles in the system. Recently, quantum embedding theories have made 
    progress in addressing this difficulty by dividing systems into smaller fragments, which 
    can themselves be treated with an accurate 'high-level' theory, perhaps even implemented on 
    a quantum computer! These local problems are coupled together 
    self-consistently via some coarse global physical quantities. 
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Variational embedding.</i></b> Our recently introduced 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00560">variational embedding theory</a> is the 
    first embedding theory which provides a guaranteed bound 
    on the ground-state energy. However, in its original formulation as an abstract semidefinite 
    program, the theory is hard to solve numerically. By making use of quantum embedding 
    intuition, we have introduced a scalable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02682">solver</a> for 
    this semidefinite program. This approach solves effective 'high-level' local problems in parallel, 
    where the effective problems are 
    determined self-consistently by updates that enforce coarse global constraints.
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Other embedding methods.</i></b>
    I have also worked on improving the scaling and robustness of existing quantum embedding 
    theories, including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00873">density matrix embedding theory</a> (DMET)
    and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07191">dynamical mean-field theory</a> (DMFT). I am also interested in 
    improving the mathematical understanding of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04796">impurity problems</a>, 
    which are the embedded subproblems in DMFT, as well as DMFT itself.

    convergence for the 1D transverse-field Ising model, maintained through the quantum phase transition at <i>h</i>=1.
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Background.</i></b> Many scientific computing problems can be viewed as optimization problems 
    over functions on high-dimensional state spaces (discrete or continuous). Such problems include the ground-state 
    eigenvalue problem for quantum many-body problems, as well as the problem of computing committor functions to  
    characterize reaction pathways in computational chemistry. A well-chosen parametric class of functions 
    (such as a tensor network or neural network parametrization) can make such an optimization problem 
    tractable.
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Variational Monte Carlo.</i></b> Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) tackles the ground-state quantum 
    many-body problem by optimizing the energy over a parametric class of wavefunctions. Parameter updates must 
    be computed by sampling configurations according to the Born rule for the wavefunction. 
    Recently, we introduced a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10558">Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton</a> approach to VMC optimization which improves 
    on existing methods for recently introduced neural-network-based parametrizations.
    <br><br>
    <b><i>High-dimensional probability.</i></b> The committor function is a fundamental object in the study of rare transitions 
    between metastable states of a stochastic process. We recently showed that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12515">tensor networks</a> can 
    be used to compute committor functions in high dimensions, allowing us to examine rare transitions in a 1D Ginzburg-Landau theory.

    Mean-field dynamics for an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02686">ensemble sampler</a>.
    <br><br>
    Monte Carlo sampling is the most flexible and widely-used tool for estimating sums and integrals in high dimensions. 
    It plays a supporting role in Variational Monte Carlo (see <u>High-dimensional functions</u> above), where 
    efficient sampling is crucial for wavefunction optimization. Conversely, parametric function classes can support the goal of Monte Carlo sampling. Some results in this area 
    should be coming soon!<br><br>

    I am also interested in generic sampling problems. We introduced an 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02686">ensemble MCMC sampler</a> that can circumvent slow 
    mixing due to metastability.

    Bold Feynman diagram expansion for the GW approximation to the Luttinger-Ward functional.
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Background.</i></b>
    Beyond the single-particle picture of density functional theory (DFT), many of the most 
    widely used computational methods in quantum many-body physics are based on the formalism 
    of Green's functions, which encode response and excitation properties of a system. Many-body 
    perturbation theory (MBPT), which expands quantities of interest perturbatively in 
    the strength of the inter-particle interaction, defines a major category of approaches to computing 
    Green's functions. The terms in this expansion correspond to the so-called 
    bare Feynman diagrams. These can in turn be reorganized into a series of bold Feynman diagrams. 
    These objects can be understood in terms of a construction called the Luttinger-Ward (LW) functional. 
    But the construction is only formal, and recently the existence 
    of a single-valued LW functional has been cast into doubt by theoretical and numerical evidence.
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Euclidean lattice field theory.</i></b> 
    We have <i>rigorously</i> justified the LW formalism in the context of Euclidean 
    lattice field theory. In particular, we have rigorously justified the 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02900">combinatorial arguments</a> underlying the
    bold diagrammatic expansion, constructed the LW functional via a 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02901">non-perturbative argument</a>, and
    and proved that the bold diagrammatic expansion forms an asymptotic series for the 
    LW functional.

    <br><br>
    <b><i>DMFT.</i></b> The dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is a quantum embedding 
    theory in which Green's functions play a central role. See <u>Quantum embedding</u> above for further 
    details on theoretical and practical work in this area.

    <b>Two views on optimal transport and its numerical solution</b> (2015).
    My undergraduate thesis (supervised by <a href="http://www2.math.umd.edu/~yanir/">Yanir Rubinstein</a> 
    and <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~rmazzeo/cgi-bin/">Rafe Mazzeo</a>), 
    which presented two new formulations of optimal transport problems leading to two corresponding methods for numerically solving them. 
    This thesis won the Kennedy Thesis Prize for the top undergraduate thesis in the natural sciences at Stanford.<br>

    <b>Asymptotics of Hermite polynomials</b> (2015). A largely expository paper 
    (for a course on orthogonal polynomials) about asymptotics of Hermite polynomials and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). 
    Presents a result about the stationary states for the quantum harmonic oscillator, which, 
    though likely nothing new, I think is fairly cool.<br>
<a href="hermite.pdf">[.pdf]</a>
<br><br>

    <b>Spectral methods for neural computation</b> (2013/14). A presentation for the 
    <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/">Brains in Silicon</a> 
    lab outlining some ideas about how favorable Fourier-domain properties of certain neural 
    tuning curves are naturally suited (in an idealized setting) for the computation of simple functions.<br>
<a href="spectral_neuro_pres.pdf">[slides]</a>
<br><br>

    <b>3D Shape Understanding Using Machine Learning</b> (2013). A presentation about my 
    work on using a deep learning framework to perform labeled segmentation of discrete 
    surfaces and extract multiscale learned shape descriptors. To help with training, 
    I introduced a new set of shape descriptors based on conformal maps.<br>

    <b>The <i>k</i>-discs algorithm and its kernelization</b> (2012). Introduces and 
    analyzes an extension of <i>k</i>-means allowing cluster centroids to be discs of 
    arbitrary dimension, capable of recovering more diverse cluster geometries.<br>
