    <h2>What I've been reading</h2> 

    The following is a list of various things that I have read (to some extent) since starting graduate school. I haven't necessarily read all (or even most) of any particular item on the list; this is just meant to record past and present interests of mine. Many items are repeated across sections. The ordering in each section is alphabetical by author.<br><br>
